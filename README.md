# open-source-machlib
The goal of this project is to create an open source equivalent of machlib: an library for inspecting Apple binary format files, particularly the iOS kernelcache. It will provide features to list library calls, system calls, kernel extensions, segments and sections and others. It will be a library that could then be used as a back-end for other tools.
